                        <li>July 7, 2022</li>
                        
                      </ul>
                      <p>Sola Odumosu lived with his parents in their rented house at Iyana-Ipaja in the latest years of the 20th century,1982 till 1990- these were periods of his growing years of childhood. At a very tender age, precisely age 3, his mother became too ambitious of her son’s intellectual wizardry and she promised to devote her time to train her son. She began the training of little Sola Odumosu with what she tagged “ fervent domestic training of my son”. She taught him to read alphabets and numbers at home and at age 4 enrolled him into nursery schools. Sola Odumosu attended Ayanfe Nursery school and Alebiosu Nursery school in Iyana-Ipaja before being enrolled at primary school. During his nursery school days Sola’s IQ was tested and was considered a genius from childhood and he topped the class, becoming the envy of other children. He moved to Oki Primary School in Iyana-Ipaja, Alimoso at age six (6) where he continued to excel. During these periods, his mother‘s illness grew worse and began to suffer from acute cough. All money gathered by the family to develop a plot of land and build the family’s house went on the sick mother to save her life. To help take care of Sola and his little brother, Olumide, his aunt, Ibukun arrived Lagos to assist her sister. At this time Mosunmola had resigned her job from the Hospital to engage in a craftwork where she could manage to take care of her children and her health.

                      <br><br>At the beginning of a new academic year, marking promotion to primary 2, Mosunmola pleaded with the school authority to take her sons to Ijebu upon the request of his paternal grandmother, Madam Comfort Odumosu alias "Ibadiaran". In the latter months of the year 1990, Sola and his brother, Olumide were taken away from Lagos to live with their grandparents in the village of Odosenbora. Both were enrolled in classes 2 and 1 respectively. At first, change of environment and separation from their biological mother who had to live with her own mother alias " Iya Ijebu" in Ijebu-Ode at the time to take care of her health,  resulted in some psychological disturbance as it brought some relegations to academic performances for nearly a year, but at promotion to primary four, the kids picked up courage and came first in the year promotional exams at Christ Church Primary School, Odosenbora, but in the following year, while another promotional exam was to be written, the death of his mother, Felicia Mosunmola was announced in the year 1992! He was advised by his headmaster, Mr Sunday Adefuye (alias Sagacity) never to allow the death of his mother deprive him of his academic excellence, and after the examination, Sola still came first. Throughout his primary school days in the village, he displayed enormous intelligence a child and excelled that he was considered and given the position of  senior prefect of the school, after he served as janitor of the school, a role which any prospective headboy was to perform then to inculcate discipline in the pupil.

                      <br><br>In the year 1994 while leaving Christ Church Anglican Primary School, Odosenbora  for his secondary education, his uncle, Taiwo Odumosu considered him too intelligent a child and asked him to begin to think of going to the city for his high education. He purchased the Common Entrance Examination form for him and asked him to compete with pupils from cities. A woman whose character reflected arrogance once mocked Sola Odumosu’s ability as a village champion but he proved himself more as a city touchbearer. He once told the story of how tattered and rough the dress he put on was on the day he was writing his Common Entrance Examination at Ijebu-Ode Grammar School and was scornfully laughed at by others. His aunt’s husband whom he lived with during his secondary school days, just came back from his farm that day, only to express his displeasure on Sola's dressing. The family waited on and on for the release of  results and Sola’s name appeared on admission lists. He had gained admission to the most prestigious school in Ijebuland.

                      <br><br>Sola at first had difficulty in blending with the city's life amidst the new academic challenges that confronted him but he summoned courage and demonstrated a great deal of academic proficiency. He lived with his cousins under strict disciplinarian guidance of their father, Mr Adeolu Olufowote who was a retired principal. His aunt, Mary Olufowote showed a great deal of benevolence to young Odumosu and promised to take the role of a mother. Sola lived with this family for six (6) years and was brought up with Christian traditions. Domestic training was fervent and he managed to blend it with academic challenges. In nearly all these, he excelled.
