                      <ul class="post-info">
                        <li>Admin</li>
                        <li>July 7, 2022</li>
                        
                      </ul>
                      <p>At the time Sola was in Ijebu-Ode Grammar School, precisely in SS 2 when he was elected the library Prefect, he joined the extra-curricular activities in the school and was encouraged by his cousin, Oluwaseun, to visit Youth Action Project (YAP) secretariat in the town - an NGO and a project of Women's Health Organisation of Nigeria (WHON) that he would meet a white woman. He decided to go one day and on getting there, was excited with the youth activities. He became very curious of the project and made enquiries. He got a satisfactory answer to his yearnings and began to make a full commitment; he joined Press Club and within a month exercised his creativity in writing and speech. He brought revival to the project that the project coordinator, Mr Tope Ekundayo, having marveled at his ingenuity, broke protocol to allow Sola take part in seminars and conferences which were only meant for Peer Health Educators (PHE) and staff. Really, Youth Action Project (YAP) was a community initiative of Women’s Health Organisation of Nigeria (WHON) targeted at Ijebu youths to develop their sexuality and mental competence. Sola found YAP as an opportunity to develop himself and he demonstrated his zeal for intellectual liberation, it was at this place that he was motivated to begin to see the world in totality.

                      <br><br>After he left Ijebu-Ode Grammar School in the year 2000, Sola never left YAP, instead he continued to use the organisation as a training ground for his IQ. YAP gave Sola an opportunity to showcase himself and he was often sent on official assignment for he had voluntarily offered himself to the service of fellow youths in the community. He assisted in the global campaign against HIV/AIDS and several other sensitization programs. His great moment of victory came when he was given an opportunity to talk at the most populated high school in Ijebuland – Adeola Odutola College, Ijebu-Ode where he addressed about 6,000 students including teaching and non teaching staff of the school in the year 2001 on the assembly ground.

                      <br><br>After this, his courage for oration grew exceedingly.  After YAP programs came to an abrupt end, Sola continued his independent campaign for youth development through his personal initiatives he called Youth Speak Network (YSN) and moved from Ijebu to Lagos, and from Lagos to Ijebu where he visited schools for series of sensitization programs and collaborated in training with Family Health International. During this period, Sola continued to develop himself and often began to ask questions about contemporary societies. Many called him a young philosopher. A brother, Tunde Ajayi, once admired his curiosity and in order to help him, gave him a book written by one of the foremost contemporary African philosophers, Prof. Joseph Omoregbe, from the University of Lagos, ”Knowing Philosophy”. He became excited and nursed the ambition of studying Philosophy in the university. He read widely, did self-study of Philosophy before his admission into university. He was motivated by the genius of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle including Immanuel Kant.

                      <br><br>Sola Odumosu was offered admission to study Geography/Social Studies in the University of Ibadan, at its affiliated institution then, Tai Solarin College of Education (now Tai Solarin University of Education) contrary to what he had wanted to study. However, lack of interest and circumstantial upheaval that heated the academic sanity of things soon became a major concern. Disappointed at the trend of things, he was deeply troubled with the skate of academic corruption that he personally launched the move for intellectual rebellion of a positive order.  He couldn't spend up to a semester before he left, thus forfeiting the admission, not because he was lazy or didn't want to go to school, but he was carrying a great knowledge within him, with an ideology that ran into conflict with the school authority. 
                      <br><br> He described this period as the time of the conception of knowledge, thus already in the labour room, about to deliver CELEBROLOGY to the world. He was often at loggerheads with his teachers for his high level of intelligence. He dropped out! Among many things that led to his intellectual deviance was what he called 'westernthinkerism', lack of intellectual independence among his lecturers, in addition to the academic corruption. He vowed to champion a new global discovery of knowledge. These periods were later years after Sola Odumosu invented Celebrology as a result of September 11 crisis.
